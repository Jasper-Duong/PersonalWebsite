          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class='intro-script'>I am currently a <strong>CS student</strong> at University of Information Technology - Vietnam National University and a <strong>music lover</strong>.
          Coding and listening to music have been playing an important role in my life for the past three years in college.
          During those years, I faced some hardship in the studying aspect of my life. 
          If it had not been for Taylor Swift's music üé∂  and the persistency in learning new technology üíª, I would have given up on pursuing a Computer Science degree by now.
          Hard work paid off as I received the full-ride scholarship for achieving the <strong>highest GPA</strong>  in the last semester amongst the CS students of my class (2018-2022).
          3 months after that, during which time I worked on SceneText Recognition using Deep Learning approach, me and my unviersity team got finalisted (<strong>top 5</strong>) in the AI Challenge 2021 held by VinAI Research and HCM city's Department of Information & Communication.

            <h3>Folklore</h3>
            <p>This has been the most therapeutic musical experiement to me. 
              Critically acclaimed, undoubtedly <strong><em>folklore</em></strong> is an irreplaceable gem of Swift's priceless musical assets.
              The stories behind each song are so relatable and easily conveyed to foreign-audiences like me, thanks to her talented story-telling.
              Definitely a conversation starter for me should you have listened to this masterpiece.

            <p>Back in 2012, when USUK pop music was all the rage, this Nashville girl has made a remarkable transition from country music to mainstream pop.
              Consequently, <strong>RED </strong> was born as a symphony of country-banjo and electric-pop materials.
              Moreover, this album marked some of the best lyrics ever been written in Taylor's career or even in the entire music industry.
              I was just 15 when this work of art came out and up until now, I still remember me dancing through 22.
